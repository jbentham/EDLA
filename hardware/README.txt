The Gerber zip file contains everything you need to get the PCB manufactured.

One PCB manufacturer said that "the opening areas on gpt and gpb are more than the soldermask layers".
Basically they are saying that there is solder mask on the surface-mount pads, making them unusuable.
The solution was for the manufacturer to derive the solder mask from gpt and gpb instead.
